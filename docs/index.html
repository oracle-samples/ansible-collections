                       <p>Oracle Linux Automation Manager (OLAM) and Oracle Linux Automation Engine are the latest additions to the Oracle Linux operating environment. 
                           Together, they provide a cost-effective, powerful, scalable, and secure infrastructure automation framework for enterprise environments. 
                           Additionally, they enable infrastructure as code, streamlining software provisioning. Also enabling configuration management, and application deployment, 
                           which in turn reduces deployment errors, time to resolve problems, and increases compliance with security, privacy, and other policies. 
                           Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Engine, based upon the open source AWX and Ansible projects respectively, are included with an Oracle Linux Premier Support subscription. </p>
                       <h3>Background</h3>
                       <p>This repository is a collection of ansible playbooks/code examples that helps automating any kind of time consuming process or operation usually executed manually. 
                          Code examples are mainly focused on automation for Oracle Products with the option to leverage those with Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Oracle Linux Automation Engine.
                          The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oracle-samples/ansible-collections/tree/main/playbooks">playbooks</a> directory contains sub-directories based on use case areas such as BTRFS, each sub-directory contains tested example playbooks
                          available for customization and reuse. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oracle-samples/ansible-collections/tree/main/templates">templates</a> directory contains example and tested template files (in j2 format) available for customization and reuse. 
                          The rest of this page will discuss and explain use cases for Oracle Linux Automation Manager referencing example playbooks.

                       <h3>Overview</h3>
                       <p>Patching is a process in which code changes, “patches”, are deployed to physical or virtual servers to rectify or update the server’s operating system or software. Patch management helps 
                        prevent data breaches by fixing security vulnerabilities. It also makes it easier to validate  that devices are running the latest software versions. Patch management is an essential part of server management.</p>
                        
                        <p>Before patching production systems, it is recommended that the end-to-end process be tested to help ensure services and operating environments provide the same or enhanced service post patching. If during testing 
                        issues are encountered, the ability to rollback to the starting point is extremely useful; saving time and effort versus trying to uninstall patches. This snapshot approach is also useful when configuration changes 
                        are due to be made, or tested, where in the case of failure a known state of service can be restored. </p>
                        
                        <p>Btrfs is a copy-on-write file system that is designed to address the expanding scalability requirements of large storage subsystems. Btrfs supports the following: snapshots, a rollback capability, checksum functionality 
                        for data integrity, transparent compression, and integrated logical volume management. </p>
                        
                        <p>The Unbreakable Enterprise Kernels (UEK) for Oracle Linux has been providing the Btrfs file system since release 5 (UEK5). The current UEK kernel is release 7 (UEK7) which is based on upstream Linux kernel 5.15.
                        For further details on UEK please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/uek/">Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel documentation</a>. On Oracle Linux, the Btrfs file system type is supported on the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) releases only. 
                        Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Oracle Linux Automation Engine are the latest additions to the Oracle Linux operating environment. Together, they provide a cost-effective, powerful, scalable, and secure infrastructure 
                        automation framework for enterprise environments. Additionally, Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Engine enable infrastructure as code, streamlining software provisioning. They also streamline configuration management, 
                        and application deployment, which in turn reduces deployment errors, time to resolve problems, and increases compliance with security, privacy, and other policies. Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Engine, based upon the open 
                        source AWX and Ansible projects respectively, are included with an Oracle Linux Premier Support subscription. </p>
                        
                        <p>This section provides examples of using Btrfs snapshots and Oracle Linux Automation Manager. The examples are based upon a target server installed with Oracle Linux 8, running Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel with Btrfs for the root filesystem. 
                        For further details on Oracle Linux please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/">official documentation</a>. </p>
                       
                        <h4>Reporting of Btrfs subvolume configuration using Oracle Linux Automation Manager</h4>
                        <p>The example files referenced below need to exist within a Project on the Oracle Linux Automation Manager either in a GIT repository or stored locally. The target Oracle Linux 8 host needs to be part of the Oracle Linux Automation Manager 
                         inventory and Credentials must exist (with sudo enabled). Finally, OLAM Templates are created to drive the playbooks created in YAML format. For further information on Oracle Linux Automation Manager please refer to the 
                         <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/8/oracle-linux-automation-manager/">Getting Started Guide</a>. </p>

                         <p>The Btrfs subvolume report playbook will perform the following:</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>Become the superuser</li>
                            <li>Check the host is running Oracle Linux 8 with UEK and has Btrfs for the root file system; if any of these conditions are false the playbook will fail</li>
                            <li>Report on the Btrfs subvolumes. There are id’s and snapshot names which are needed for the rollback, delete and rename playbooks</li>
                            <li>Report on the ID of the current boot volume</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A successful result contains these sections of output from the Template Job:</p>

                        <h4>Create a Btrfs snapshot then update / patch to the latest using Oracle Linux Automation Manager</h4>
                        <p>Before updating the host to the latest patches / packages a snapshot of the current Btrfs default subvolume is taken to provide a rollback environment, 
                            should the update cause issues to any services.  </p>
     
                              <p>The create Btrfs snapshot and update playbook which runs on an Oracle Linux 8 host will perform the following:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Become the superuser</li>
                                 <li>Take input from the Template for the variable snapshot_name which will be a directory name and therefore should avoid special characters</li>
                                 <li>Check the host is running Oracle Linux 8 with UEK and has Btrfs for the root file system; if any of these conditions are false the playbook will fail</li>
                                 <li>Check and fail the job if /mnt is already mounted. If it is not mounted, the command will fail but will be ignored and continue</li>
                                 <li>Check and create if /mnt does not exist</li>
                                 <li>Obtain and display the Btrfs top level subvolume id</li>

                       <p>If it is necessary to remove a Btrfs snapshot, the remove Btrfs snapshot playbook which runs on an Oracle Linux 8 host will perform the following:</p>
                       <ul>
                           <li>Take input from the Template for the variable snapshot_name. The remove playbook will append the string to the snapshot directory (for example snapshots/"{{ snapshot_name }}"</li>
                           <li>Become the superuser</li>
                           <li>Check the host is running Oracle Linux 8 with UEK and has Btrfs for the root file system; if any of these conditions are false the playbook will fail</li>
                           <li>Check and fail the job if /mnt is already mounted. If it is not mounted, the command will fail but will be ignored and continue</li>
                           <li>Check and fail if the default snapshot (the currently booted subvolume) is the delete target</li>
                           <li>Check and create if /mnt does not exist</li>
                           <li>Obtain and display the Btrfs top level subvolume id</li>

                           <li>Unmount /mnt</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>From the Template an example of the snapshot_name variable which needs to match the target snapshot name. Note that Prompt on Launch is enabled and will present this screen for user input

                        The playbooks use the Quick Install using Configuration File installation scenario.
                        An OCNE configuration file includes all information about the environments and modules you want to create.
                        This file in combination with the quick install procedure of OCNE saves repeated steps in the installation process.

                        <p>
                        The Inventory defines the hostnames and roles in the OCNE cluster deployment. Example inventory files 
                        are provided in the <i>&lt;playbookdir&gt;/inventories</i> directory. Variables add additional configuration 
                        parameters such as container-registry, high availability, environment names or module names. Example variables
                        are provided in the <i>&lt;playbookdir&gt;/group_vars</i> directory. A full list of required variables are
                        listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oracle-samples/ansible-collections/tree/main/playbooks/OCNE">OCNE folder README file</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Oracle Linux Automation Manager create a new inventory for the OCNE cluster deployment and populate
                        the groups, hosts and variables as described in the example <i>hosts.ini</i> and <i>group_vars/all.yml</i> 
                        files.

                        <h3>Running Playbooks</h3>
                        <p>There are several playbooks to be used in the deployment of OCNE, the overview of the deployment-playbooks
                        is available in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oracle-samples/ansible-collections/tree/main/playbooks/OCNE">OCNE folder README file</a>.
                        Create a Job Workflow to install an entire cluster based on the provided playbooks (eg a workflow with prepare-ocne-deployment.yml, provision-ocne.yml), 
                        optionally there are playbooks for other modules such as the OCI-CCM module to setup a Oracle Cloud OCI 
                        load balancer. Multiple deployment-playbooks may be configured in a workflow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In below screenshot a Workflow Template is created for the sample game application. When launched with 
                        the earlier created OCNE inventory it will install a complete kubernetes cluster on the selected hosts in the Inventory.

                         <p>From the playbooks directory within our lab we created a directory called ssh. In here we placed a public key (called oci_id_rsa.pub) which is passed to the target instance for later connection using the opc user.

                        </p> 
                        <p>Before we can use the OLVM playbooks we need to install the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ovirt/ovirt/ovirt_vm_module.html#ansible-collections-ovirt-ovirt-ovirt-vm-module">ovirt.ovirt.ovirt_vm module</a>.

                        above but describes how to use the OCI module. If you have followed these steps to use the OCI module then simply change your requirements.yaml file within your collections directory to be:</p>
                        <pre>---
                            collections:
                              - name: oracle.oci
                              - name: ovirt.ovirt
                        </pre>
                        <p>Then run a resync on your GIT based Project, this should install the ovirt module. If you have not configured OCI then just have the single entry for ovirt.ovirt.</p>
                        <p>We also need password information which should be in the following form with a filename such as ovirt_passwords.yaml and placed in a directory such as /var/lib/awx/projects/files which should be owned by the awx user:</p>
                        <pre>---
                            olvm_password: Welcome1

                        </pre>
                        <p>These are password variables which we want to pass to the playbook in an encrypted form. Once the file is created then run the following:</p>
                        <pre>sudo ansible-vault encrypt ./ovirt_passwords.yaml
                        </pre>
                        <p>This will ask for a Vault password which is similar to an ssh passphrase which will encrypt the file. Following the encryption cat the file which will produce something similar to:</p>
                        <pre>$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256

                        <p>We need the Vault password used to encrypt the file to create a Vault Credential to allow OLAM to decyrpt the file at runtime and enable the password variables to be used within the playbook. 
                        To do this, via the OLAM UI, go Credentials > Green Plus to Add a credential of type Vault. Enter the Vault password which will then encrypt the entry and look similar to the screenshot below:

                        <h3> Overview </h3>
                        <p>The Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), which is published by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), is a document that provides guidance on configuring a system to meet cybersecurity requirements for deployment within the Department of                 Defense (DoD) IT network systems. 
                           The  STIG guidelines have been included in the scap-security-guide package available under the ol8_appstream channel, which can be used with the openscap tool for evaluating the compliance of an Oracle Linux installation.
                            Individual rules and the remediation details are well documented in <a href="https://static.open-scap.org/ssg-guides/ssg-ol8-guide-standard.html">sisg-ol8-guide-standard</a>.
                           The scap-security-guide available for Oracle Linux 8 machines provides the remediation playbooks for different profiles including STIG, which is located under /usr/share/scap-security-guide/ansible/ .
                           <br>Ensuring the systems are compliant to the STIG rules would require manual modifications to the configuration files which can not only be time consuming but also prone to human errors.</br>
                           <br>Using ansible playbook, the manual tasks can be automated to multiple servers in a short duration.</br>

                        </p>
                        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                                <ul>
                                 <li>SSH access for root user to the target machines on which the remediation will be applied.</li>
                                 <li> Inventories, Credentials, Project set up from the OLAM Manager. </li>
                                 <li> The scope of the playbook is for on premise Oracle Linux 8 machines. </li></ul>
                        <h3>Installing openscap</h3>
                         <p> On the target systems where the remediation will be applied, ensure to have the latest version of OpenSCAP package installed.
                             Run an initial scan against the STIG profile using the following command to understand the compliance score and the rules marked as failure. </p>
                         <pre>
                          # oscap xccdf eval  --profile stig  --results /tmp/<path-to-result>.xml --report /tmp/<path-to-report>.html --cpe /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ol8-cpe-dictionary.xml  /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ol8-xccdf.xml 
                         </pre>
                                 <p>If there are a large number of target hosts, the same can be automated using a simple playbook as follows: </p>
                        <pre>
                          - hosts: all
                            tasks:
 
                             - name: install openscap scanner
                               package:
                                  name: openscap
                                  state: latest
                               with_items:
                                 - openscap-scanner
                                 - scap-security-guide
 
                             - name: run openscap
                               command: oscap xccdf eval \
                                        --profile stig \
                                        --results /tmp/ssg.xml
                                        --report /var/www/html/ssg-results.html \
                                        --cpe /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ol8-cpe-dictionary.xml \
                                        /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ol8-xccdf.xml \
                               ignore_errors: True
                        </pre> 
                        <p> The above playbook stores the report at /var/www/html/ssg-results.html and results at /tmp/ssg.xml respectively. The playbook is also available in the Github repository </p>

                                        - NIST-800-53-AU-9(3).1

                              </pre>
                             <li>Every task is associated with a tag that can be used when executing the template from the OLAM Manager, using which only required remediation can be applied.</li>
                                 Few of the common tags include : no_reboot_required, medium_complexity, restrict_strategy, low_disruption.
                              <figure><image src= "files/Picture19.png"  alt="Job Tags" style="width: 540px; height: 200px;" /> </figure>                          
                              <li>Similarly, the tasks which are not required can be skipped using "Skip Tags" from OLAM when launching the template.</li>
                              <figure><image src= "files/Picture20.png"  alt="Skip Job Tags" style="width: 587px; height: 262px;" /> </figure>  
                              <li>Once the template is launched, the tasks will be executed sequentially. </li>
                             <figure><image src= "files/Picture21.png"  alt="Skip Job Tags" style="width: 587px; height: 262px;" /> </figure> </ul>
                     <h3>Considerations before applying the playbook</h3> 
                       <p>As part of applying remediation, there would be multiple modifications made and hence it is necessary to review each tasks. Here are few examples:
                       <ul>
                       <li> DISA-STIG-OL08-00-010550 - Disables SSH root login. SSH session to the servers might give an "Access Denied" error. </li>
                       <li> DISA-STIG-OL08-00-010020 - Enables FIPS, very rarely the system might halt at boot pointing to FIPS.</li>
                       <li>DISA-STIG-OL08-00-010670 - Disables kdump services. </li>
                       </ul>

                     <h3>Rescanning for Compliance</h3>
                     <p> Post running the playbook, rescan the system using OpenSCAP tool to check the achieved compliance score </p>
                     <pre> 
                       $ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile stig\
                         --results=path-to-results.xml --oval-results \
                         --report=path-to-report.html \
                         --check-engine-results path-to-xccdf-document
