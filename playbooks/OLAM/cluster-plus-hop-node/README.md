# Oracle Linux Automation Manager 2.0 Cluster

The playbook provides a clustered installation of [Oracle Linux Automation Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux-automation-manager/) using the details from an inventory file.

It configures the following seven nodes:

- A remote database
- Two control plane nodes
- Two local execution nodes
- A hop node and a remote execution node

## Quickstart

### Assumptions

1. You have all the hosts running
1. You have setup the required OpenSSH keys
1. You have the necessary permissions and access

### Pre-requisites

1. Git is installed
1. SSH client is installed and configured
1. The `ansible` or `ansible-core` package is installed

### Instructions
---

#### Provisioning using this git repo

1. Clone the repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/oracle-samples/ansible-collections.git ol-playbooks
    cd ol-playbooks/OLAM/cluster-plus-hop-node
    cp group_vars/all.yml.example group_vars/all.yml
    cp inventory/hosts.ini.example inventory/hosts.ini
    ```

1. Edit the group variables:

    ```
    # Create Linux non-opc user account for installing Oracle Linux Automation Manager
    
    "username": oracle
    
    # Enter the non-hashed password for the non-opc user account.
    
    "user_default_password": oracle
    
    # Enter the name of a local ssh keypair located in the ~/.ssh directory. This key appends
    # to the non-opc user account's authorized_keys file.
    
    "ssh_keyfile": id_rsa
    ```

    This file also contains a variable for setting a proxy if required to reach the internet from the Oracle Linux Automation Manager nodes.

1. Edit the inventory:

    ```
    [control_nodes]
    control-node01
    control-node02
    
    [control_nodes:vars]
    node_type=control
    peers=local_execution_group

    [execution_nodes]
    execution-node01
    execution-node02
    execution-remote-node01
    hop-node01

    [local_execution_group]
    execution-node01
    execution-node02

    [hop]
    hop-node01

    [hop:vars]
    peers=control_nodes

    [remote_execution_group]
    execution-remote-node01

    [remote_execution_group:vars]
    peers=hop

    [db_nodes]
    db-remote

    [all:vars]
    ansible_user=opc
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
    ```    
    
    The `all:vars` group variables define the user, key file, and python version used when connecting to the different nodes using SSH.

1. Test SSH connectivity to all the hosts listed in the inventory:

    ```
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini pingtest.yml
    ```

1. Install collection dependencies:

    ```
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
    ```
    
1. Run the playbook:

    ```

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini install.yml
    ```
